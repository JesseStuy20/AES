# AES
## Project Description
In our project, we explain what the Advanced Encryption Standard is, some of the history behind it, and the steps to encrypt and decrypt messages with it. We've included a program that fully encrypts and decrypts messages with a 16 character long key and a presentation to complement it. The encryption mode accepts an input in ascii and returns the encrypted message as hexademical values, while the decryption mode accepts an input in hexadecimal seperated by spaces and returns the decrypted message in ascii.

## Usage Instructions
Clone the repository in your desired destination:  
`$ git clone git@github.com:JesseStuy20/AES.git`  

Change your directory to the cloned repository:  
`$ cd AES/`  

Edit the key and input file, or make your own.

Use the Python program for your encrypted/decrypted message:  
`$ python3 aes.py [encrypt/decrypt] [key-file] [input-file]`
